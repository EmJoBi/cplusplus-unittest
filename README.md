# cplusplus-unittest
Example of a simple C++ unit test using the Google Test framework.

The repo https://github.com/google/googletest must be cloned in the same
parent directory as this repo is cloned.  That is, this repo assumes
Google Test is present as ../googletest.  If it's somewhere else, just
change the first line of Makefile.
